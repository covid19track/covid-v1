# COVID-19.Tracker
### COVID-19.Tracker is an open-source pandemic analysis tool, with it you can get information about the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.

## The Concept
COVID-19.Tracker is a web-server that fetches, processes and renders data related to the 2019-2020's coronavirus outbreak.

Fetching data: 
- Summary; how many people are infected, how many recovered and how many have died.
- Country-wise data; recovered per country, how many cases were found a specific day in a country, etc.
- Automated chart generation based on information about the ten most infected countries, this happens in real time.

## Under the hood
* HTML5/CSS/JS is the frontend
* NodeJS + Express is the backend
* Axios is fetching the data from [this](https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries)
